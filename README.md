# DKPro Uby
DKPro Uby is a Java framework for creating and accessing sense-linked lexical resources in accordance with the UBY-LMF lexicon model, an instantiation of the ISO standard Lexicon Markup Framework (LMF). The software library includes the following modules:

  * an implementation of the UBY-LMF lexicon model
  * tools for the conversion of a variety of lexical resources to the standard-compliant format UBY-LMF
  * tools for computing pairwise alignments between resources
  * tools for creating and accessing UBY-LMF compliant databases, also within UIMA pipelines

## Learning UBY
Using UBY requires solid knowledge of lexical resources, such as WordNet and FrameNet and their underlying concepts. 
For instance, you should be able to tell the difference between a sense and a synset. 

Learn these foundations and how to use UBY by walking through a detailed tutorial on *Linked Lexical Resources*, see https://dkpro.github.io/dkpro-uby/
